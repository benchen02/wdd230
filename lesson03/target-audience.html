        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <h3>Scenario 1</h3>
        <p>
          Eva Wong is trying to sell to a prospective client in selling a house
          however the house is next to a busy street so can get kind of loud.
          But because she looked up using the San Gabriel Chamber of Commerce
          site, she found places that were near by and showed the client how
          convienent it was for them to find someplace to eat or the
          recreational events near by. And so she managed to convince the client
          that having a bit of noise is worth the cost of living in near such
          convienences.
        </p>

        <h3>Scenario 2</h3>

          wanting to know what are some of the historical sites that he could
          visit in the valley. Maybe also find some place to eat in the mean
          time. He would also like to know how the weather is like so that he
          can pack for the apporiate clothing. The San Gabriel Chamber of
          Commerece site is prefect as it has everything he needs to know.
        </p>

        <h3>Scenario 3</h3>
        <p>
          Eva Wong has a client that is looking for a place to open up a
          restraunt. The client is relatively new to the area and Eva sugguests
          that he should join the San Gabriel Chamber of Commerece as there he
          can promote his business and hopefully attract client to his
          restraunt.
        </p>

        <h3>Scenario 4</h3>
        <p>
          Jack Michael is just passing through the San Gabriel Valley but it's

          for the night. He looks through the San Gabriel Chamber of Commerce
          site to find a decent place to eat and stay for a night. Not looking
          for much but the site will give him trustworthy business to look up.

          for a studio near a park. She looks through the San Gabriel Chamber of
          Commerece site to see which parks may interest her client and help
          them find a place that isn't too far to the client's preference. She
