            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <p class="title">The Weather Channel</p>
            <a href="https://weather.com">https://weather.com</a>

            <p>Though there is a PC website, I think the mobile browser is better at showing this example 
                because on mobile what catches your eye first is the purple section which is where the information, 
                you’re looking for about the weather can be found. The temperature is big and bold as that’s the first 
                thing people look for when checking the weather, then you have the other smaller details like how cloudy
                it is and chance of rain. Then they show you a weekly report if you’re interested to see what it would 
                be like during the week. If you’re on the computer, it kind of accomplishes the same thing but the 
                current weather is much smaller so it’s not as visible, but you do get a header of timeframes that 
                takes you to another page. I still think the mobile site is much better at visual hierarchy as it shows 
                you the most important information first. </p>

            <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
            <p class="title">Etsy</p>

            <img src="images/etsy.jpg" alt="Etsy Mobile Screenshot">
            <p>Now Etsy’s home page is nice to look at. Not only does it use light colors so it’s not harsh on the eyes, 
                but it also has a decent amount of white space between its section/products. This gives you a sense of 
                organization, but it also helps people see clearer. I also think that because of their spacing, 
                it feels almost comfortable just browsing through their selection of products almost like you’re at a 
                physical store just 5browsing the aisles. </p>

            <h3>P.A.R.C Proximity</h3>
            <p class="title">Stardew Valley Wiki</p>
            <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki">https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki</a>
            <img src="images/sdv.jpg" alt="Stardew Valley Wiki Mobile Screenshot">
            <p>Stardew Valley wiki on the other hand, is cluttered with information. It’s understandable as the game 
                itself does have a lot, so they need find a way to organize all that information and they decided to 
                put similar things together and even has subsections to help with that. You have the basics of the game 
                together with the about section, so you know what the game is about. Then you have the meat of the game 
                which is information about the mechanics of the game and what to do, then finally you have the valley 
                and environment which gives you information on the various places and the environment of said location. 
                Everything that is related is grouped together nicely and how one section guides you into another 
                (How to start playing leads into gameplay which leads to location and environment). </p>
