        <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
        <h4>Amazon</h4>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com">https://www.amazon.com</a>

        <p>
          The reason why I chose Amazon.com for Visual Hierarchy is because they
          do really well in trying to catch your attention in what they want,
          specifically their service. The first thing you see when you open the
          page is a big advertisement about prime video then just above that you
          see where you can sign in if you have an account. Though when people
          go to Amazon.com, they already have an idea of what they want to buy,
          so a search button is placed at the very top followed by some
          categroies that may interest some people like deals or best sellers.

        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
        <h4>QuickBooks Online</h4>

        <p>
          The reason why I chose QuickBooks Online is because just look at the
          amount of space they give everything. They use white space to make
          things look clean and clear. Now QuickBooks Online is an online
          accounting software so I do think that even though it may seem much is
          required so that when you're staring at the reports hours, it's easier
          on the eyes as well as making everything clear at a glance. Again, it
          may seem like it's alot of white space, but it's to make everything
          look clean and clear to the user.

        <h3>PARC: Alignment</h3>
        <h4>YouTube</h4>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com">https://www.youtube.com</a>
        <img src="images/youtube.png" alt="YouTube Mobile Screenshot" />
        <p>
          I believe that youtube is a great example on Alignment in both the
          mobile web, app, and actual website. On the mobile and app, all the
          videos are centered and every page you may be looking for from the
          homepage to your subscription box is centered on the bottom. There's
          even a bit of friendly UI as it stays at the bottem of the screen
          instead of the bottem of the page. On the actual site, the pages
          you're looking for are from a collapsable menu on the side while the
          videos are in a grid to make it easier to see everything you need to
          know about the video.
