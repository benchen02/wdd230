            <h3>The Light cathedrial</h3>
            <p>The interior of the mountain cathedrial just outside of town. The cathedrial was
                believed to be used by a lost and forgotten religion as there were many relics found 
                in the cathedrial that you can check out at our local museum. We estimate that
                the cathedrial was established several hundred years ago, but stood the test of time.
                That fact alone along with our local histroians helping with maintenance made sure that
                these walls will be preserved for even longer.

            <h3>Taste of Italy</h3>
            <p>Check out the grand opening of our new Italian restaurant, Taste of Italy. Serves almost
                every type of dish you may find in a classic Italian restaurant from pastas to risottos.
                They also may have weekly deals and the owners are a joy to talk with. One critic rated
                the restraunt 9/10, saying that the food was amazing for what they were charging as well
                as having a welcoming and friendly atmosphere.

            <h3>Night Life</h3>
            <p>Our city has some weekly night time activities from late night restraunts and shops to 
                concerts and parties from touring or local bands. Don't worry about disturbing the rest as
                this part of town is kept away from the resedential area. Though there are housing a few
                blocks away, the residents there are usually regulars of the late night festivities. Keep
                a look out for any events coming soon.

            <h3>Gabriela's Dry cleaning</h3>
            <p>Grand opening of another dry cleaner. Opening earlier this year, there wasn't many 
                customers to begin with, but with some advertising and a friendly owner, it quickly grew.
                The price of servces was quite affordable as well. They do things quickly, but effectively
                and claims that clients will be able to pick up their dry cleaning the next day.

            <h3>Town Hall's Clock Tower</h3>
            <p>Our town hall clock tower. It's been here since the town was established in the 1920's and is the 
                town's pride as well as it's center piece. The town hall is just below the clock tower with the 
                town square right in front of it. The clock tower is currently under maintenance as it is getting
                some parts replaced and probably won't function for another week or so.
