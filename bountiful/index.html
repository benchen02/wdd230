        <h2>A bit about the coastal cities</h2>
        <h3>Los Angeles Area</h3>
        <p>Los Angeles is the second largest city in the U.S., it is situated between the San Gabriel 
          Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. Bisected by the Santa Monica Mountains, which separate the neighbourhoods of Hollywood, 
          Beverly Hills, and Pacific Palisades from the San Fernando Valley. It is near the San Andreas Fault and earthquakes are frequent. 
          It began in 1771 as a Spanish mission; in 1781 settlers claimed the land as El Pueblo de la Reyna de los Angeles 
          (“the Town of the Queen of the Angels”). Taken by U.S. forces in the Mexican War, it prospered in the wake of the 1849 gold rush. 
          Incorporated in 1850, the city grew rapidly after the arrival of the railroads in 1876 and 1885. In 1913 an aqueduct was built to supply 
          it with water from the slopes of the Sierra Nevada. It was struck by a major earthquake in 1994. Sites of interest 
          include early Spanish missions, the Getty Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Museum of Contemporary Art. 
          Educational institutions include the University of Southern California, Occidental College, and the University of California at Los Angeles.</p>

          <h3>San Deigo Area</h3>
          <p>San Deigo is located on San Diego Bay, the site of major naval and military bases. Sighted by the Spanish in 1542 and named San Miguel, 
            the area was renamed to San Diego in 1602. In 1769 the Spanish established a military post on the site, and Junípero Serra dedicated the first 
            California mission there. The U.S. acquired it from Mexico in 1846, and a new city was laid out in 1867. The arrival of the Santa Fe railroad 
            in 1885 stimulated the city's growth. Industrial development is dominated by aerospace, electronics, and shipbuilding, and the city is 
            the main commercial outlet for the farm produce of southern California. Balboa Park and its San Diego Zoo are renowned, as are the area universities.</p>

            <h3>Orange County</h3>
            <p>Orange, city, Orange county, southern California, U.S. Adjacent to Anaheim (west) and Santa Ana (south), it lies along the Santa Ana River. 
              Part of Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana, the city was founded as Richland in 1869 by Alfred Chapman and Andrew Glassell, who received the land 
              as payment for legal fees. The town was laid out in 1871 and renamed in 1875 for its orange groves. Both the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe 
              railways arrived in the 1880s, encouraging development of the area. Orange was initially a citrus-packing centre. It subsequently developed 
              with the Los Angeles metropolitan area and acquired some light manufacturing. Orange is the seat of Chapman University (established 1861 in Los Angeles, 
              relocated 1954) and a community college (1985). Inc. city, 1888. Pop. (2010) 136,416; (2020) 139,911.</p>
