              many food trucks that cover the coastal area from Los Angeles to San Diego. We sell fruits and produce

              walk in traffic at our storefront in Carlsbad and, of course, our food trucks. We deliver and manage those orders on the phone 
              and via the website.</p>

            <h2>A Little Bit About Carlsbad</h2>
            <p>Carlsbad is located north of San Diego, Carlsbad lies along a lagoon on the Pacific Ocean just south of Oceanside, 
              in a winter vegetable- and flower-growing district. Luise√±o Indians long inhabited the location before Spanish settlement in the 18th century. 
              Founded as a cattle station located along the Spanish Camino Real (royal highway) and settled by Anglo ranchers in the late 1860s, it was first 
              called Frazier's Station but was renamed in 1883, when its mineral waters were found to be similar to those of Karlsbad in Bohemia 
              (now Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic). After the arrival of the Santa Fe Railway in 1885, the city's fine beaches spurred its development 
              as a popular health resort and vacation destination. Electronics, biomedical, and high-technology firms and light industry supplement the economy. 
              The city is the site of Legoland California, a family-oriented park that opened in 1999. Other popular attractions include the Children's Discovery 
              Museum of North County, the historic Leo Carrillo Ranch, and the colourful Flower Fields.</p>

          <h2>Our Histroy</h2>
          <p>Founded in 1992, we wanted a place where people could get fresh products from local sources and so we started a farmer's market. After a while, farmers found
            success as their products were fresh and were drawing in new people from all over the coast and decided to try and expand their market. They decided to send their
            products to near by cities to advertise and eventually found success in selling fresh fruits and vegetables in those near by cities. We now sell fresh fruits
            and produce across the Southern California Coast, all mostly fresh from local sources so that we may support our local farmers, who bring in fresh, quality products.
