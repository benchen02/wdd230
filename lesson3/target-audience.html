            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <h3>Scenario 1</h3>
            <p>Gabriela is looking to open up her business and is wanting to look for a place with very little competition
                so she decides to visit the Mountain Valley Chamber of Commerce site in order to see what business there are.
                She sees that there aren't alot of places selling the products that she's wanting to sell, so decides the 
                location of her business and gets to work researching the area and lease prices in the area.
            </p>

            <h3>Scenario 2</h3>
            <p>Gabriela has now bought and done renovations to the building she just bought and is now ready to open for business.
                At first, business is slow, but because of the low competition, it starts very slowly picking up business. With
                that said, she noticed that even with business picking up slowly it wasn't really busy and at most only had a few
                customers at a time so decided to look at and join in the chamber of commerce for The Mountain Valley and look for 
                connections and start networking from there.
            </p>

            <h3>Scenario 3</h3>
            <p>John Johnson was looking for his next big investment. He decided to one day just browse through the local business
                on the chamber site to see if anything caught is attention. As he was scrolling through the site, he made a list 
                of a few businesses that caught his attention that were either looking for help or just wanted to expand.
            </p>

            <h3>Scenario 4</h3>
            <p>John Johnson was looking to expand his network this time around and saw that a few businesses opening up. 
                Some he saw were already established and were just expanding, others however sounded new. So, he spent the rest of
                the week meeting these new business owners and giving them an opportunity to establish a network themselves using
                his own network as a starting point. 
            </p>

            <h3>Scenario 5</h3>
            <p>Gabriela now has a successful buisiness in the area thanks to resources that the chamber site gave her. She now
                has her own network and is now helping other business owners that are just starting and giving them advice on 
                what to do. She, like John Johnson, are giving them an opportunity to establish and grow their own network using 
                the site and her own network as a basis.
