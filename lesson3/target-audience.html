        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        <p>My target audience would be people that are wanting to incorporate weather into thier planning
            as well as people that may be interested in top restraunts and the local news. 
        </p>

        <h3>Personas</h3>
    <section>
        <h4>Persona 1</h4>
        <p>Lily is a 22 year old foodie and blogger. She started a blog about the restraunts she went to at 16. Then 
            she was just following her parents around as they loved to go out and eat and so she started
            a blog to review these restraunts. Her blog started small but quickly gained traction and now people look
            for her reviews to see where to eat. Becausee of this, she got picked up by a magazine company so now
            travels quite a bit so she can experience and critique the local restraunts.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h4>Person 2</h4>
        <p> Mike is an 30 year old outdoorsy type of person. The kind of person that loves going camping, beaches, and the likes. He 
            also loves playing sports casually with his friends and is usually the main planner of road trips. He runs 
            an online business of selling sports gear and camping tools. But since he's loves the out doors, it would be
            nice to plan for weather and know what are some good local restraunts he can stop by during his road trips.

        <h3>Scenarios</h3>
    <section>
        <h4>Scenerio 1</h4>
        <p>Lily is planning another trip to a small town. When she arrives there she would like to know what the local weather 
            like during her stay. She logs into our site to see that a new restraunt in the town is getting great reviews and so 
            goes to check it out. 
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Scenerio 2</h4>
        <p> Lily is stuck in traffic and so wants to know what happened. She logs on and finds that there has been a major accedent
            up ahead. So she calls in her boss and tells him the situation. His boss is understanding as it's been snowing heavily 
            lately. Though the snowing should stop within the next weeks.

    <section>
        <h4>Scenerio 3</h4>
        <p> Mike is wanting to plan for another road trip as he recently got a big order done and has the time and money to spare. 
            When he plans this trip he wants to know how the weather will be in the next days at their locations as well as what
            restraunts are good at the locale.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Scenerio 4</h4>
        <p> Mike is planning on playing ball with his friends after they get off from work. However, looking at the website, they may 
            want to postpone or cancel is the weather states that it's going to rain tonight and tomorrow. Maybe a nice camping trip out 
            to the desert for the weekend might be a better plan.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h4>Scenerio 5</h4>
        <p> Lily is concerned about a local shooting that happened yesterday. Luckly, everyone she knew was safe, but she still wanted to 
            keep up to date about the event. So she logs in and sees that the suspect of the shooting has been caught and arrested, easing
            her mind that it's safer to go to work now.
